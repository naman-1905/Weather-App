# ğŸŒ¦ Weather App

A **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS** based weather application that provides **real-time weather updates** based on your location.  
It automatically detects your city using IP geolocation and fetches live weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, and more, from [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/).
This App was created in order to understand the implementation of API keys, env.local file and async functions to return values from the JSON API Data.
